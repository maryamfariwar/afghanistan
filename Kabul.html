            <p>
            <b>Kabul is the capital and largest city of Afghanistan, situated in a mountain valley at approximately 1,800 meters above sea level. <br>
                With a population of over 4 million, <br>it serves as the country’s political, cultural, and economic center.<br>
                 Kabul has a rich history that spans over 3,500 years, >having been part of major empires including the Achaemenids, Kushans, and Mughals.<br>
                  Once known for its vibrant culture and strategic importance along ancient trade routes, the city has endured decades of conflict, <br>
                  particularly during the civil war of the 1990s and the U.S.-led war after 2001.
                   It fell under Taliban control in August 2021, marking a major shift in governance and daily life.<br>
                   Today, Kabul remains a city of resilience, home to historical sites like Babur’s Gardens and the National Museum,<br> even as it grapples with economic hardship, security concerns, and social restrictions.</b>

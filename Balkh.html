           <b> Balkh Province is one of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan,<br> located in the northern part of the country. 
            It's one of Afghanistan's most historically significant regions and has long been a cultural and economic center.
        <br>Balkh city (now a small town near Mazar-i-Sharif) was once known as Bactra, the capital of ancient Bactria, a prominent center in the Persian and Hellenistic worlds.
            It was a major hub for Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, and later, Islamic scholarship.
            Known as the "Mother of Cities" (Umm al-Bilad) due to its historical significance.
            Destroyed by the Mongols in the 13th century but later rebuilt.<br>
            Located in northern Afghanistan, bordering Uzbekistan to the north.
            Shares internal borders with Samangan, Jowzjan, Sar-e Pol, and Baghlan provinces.
            The Amu Darya river forms part of the northern boundary.
            Features both mountainous terrain and fertile plains.
